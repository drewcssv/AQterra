Welcome to the Repo to build complete AQterra Community Air Quality portal. 

AQterra Community Air Quality Portal

To really drill down into the data that your BackpAQ has collected you need to utilize the AQView toolset. AQterra provides a comprehensive set of data mapping, visualization and charting tools which really bring the air quality data to life. 

Very generally, AQterra displays each BackpAQ sensor’ data  (yours and your fellow teachers and students) on a Google Map, in approximately the location of the BackpAQ’s last position. You can then click on the icon representing the BackpAQ to see the current sensor values, as well as options to display in graph form.
